    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim is to make operations as fast as possible: inserting new items or removing given items from the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays are data structures where all items are identified with an index — an integer starting with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The items of the array are located **right next to each other** in the main memory (**RAM**) — they can be accessed by the **index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every single item (value) can be identified with a given index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indexes start with 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Access:** items are located next to each other so we can get then with the help of the index — in ***O(1)*** running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays must contain the same type of element (int, str, ...) except dynamically-typed arrays like lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More complex data structures heavily rely on arrays because of **random indexing — *O(1)*** access of items with known indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stacks, queues or dictionaries (hash - tables)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerical methods** use arrays: most the operations can be achieved quite efficiently — matrix related operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. adding items:** we can insert new items at the end of the data structure untill the data structure is not full — ***O(1)*** running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory & Running Time Trade-Off\n",
    "- **start with a small sized array:** we do not waste memory **but** often times we have te resize the array with ***O(N)***  running time.\n",
    "- **allocate a huge array at the beginning:** we do waste memory because of the large size but at least we do not have to bother with the resize operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. adding element to an arbitrary positions:** we want to insert an item to an arbitrary position — so with a given index. Say, you want to put `X` to *2nd index* on\n",
    "        \n",
    "> `array  = [Y   Z   T   K   L   M]`\n",
    "       \n",
    "Simply put `X` to the *2nd index* and shift the rest of the array;\n",
    "        \n",
    "> `array = [Y   Z   X   T   K   L   M]`\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an ***O(N)*** linear running time algorithm because the items must be shifted (in the worst-case, all the items has to be shifted).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. removing the last item:** removing the last element of an array is quite easy and fast operation — ***0(1)*** running time. \n",
    "    Remove the last element from the `array`:\n",
    "            \n",
    "> `array = [Y   Z   X   T   K   L]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. removing item from an arbitrary position:** usually, we don't know the index of the item we want to remove. Also, another issue we have to deal with is the after removing an item, there are so-called 'holes' in the array.\n",
    "    Remove the element on the *3rd index* from the `array`:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `array = [Y   Z   X   HOLE   K   L]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The process will be *O(N)* linear time operation So;<br>\n",
    "> - First find the element — *O(N)*,<br>\n",
    "> - Then remove the element — *O(1)*,<br>\n",
    "> - Finally, shift the remaining elements — *O(N)*<br>\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "1. Manipulating the last item (insertion / removal):\n",
    "> ***O(1)*** — running time\n",
    "2. Manipulating an arbitrary item (insertion / removal):\n",
    "> ***O(N)*** running time — if these kinds of operations will dominate, then array data structure is not the best option.\n",
    "3. The best feature of arrays is **random access**, we can access arbitrary items extremely fast with indexes.\n",
    "4. Quite an **easy data structure**, easy to understand and implement as well.\n",
    "5. Use arrays when you want to manipulate the **last items** of the data structure, or you want to access items with **known indexes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "1. We have to know the number of items we want to store at *compile time* — so it is not a dynamic data structure.\n",
    "2. Since it's not dynamic — whenever the data structure is full, we have to resize it on ***O(N)*** linear running time.\n",
    "3. Can't store items with different types in an array — except Python."
